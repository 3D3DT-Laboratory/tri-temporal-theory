## 🎯 Key Results

### Three Independent Empirical Pillars

**Pillar 1: Universal Breathing Scale**
- λ_b = 4.30 ± 0.15 kpc detected in 95.2% of galaxies
- Confirmed independently in pulsar timing (NANOGrav)
- Agreement: 2.4% between methods

**Pillar 2: Mass-Dependent Amplitude**
- σ ∝ M^0.30±0.06 across 10 orders of magnitude
- Galaxies: α = 0.34 ± 0.05, p < 10⁻¹⁵
- Pulsars: β = 0.28 ± 0.09, p = 0.002
- **No alternative theory predicts this**

**Pillar 3: Critical Mass Threshold**
- M_crit = (2.43 ± 0.31) × 10¹⁰ M☉
- Phase transition between Q-dominated and Newtonian regimes
- 3% agreement with theoretical prediction

### Model Comparison
- 83% improvement over ΛCDM
- Bayes Factor: 10²⁴ (single test), 10¹⁴⁵ (combined)
- χ²_reduced = 1.12 (excellent fit)

## 🔬 Theory Summary

The 3D+3D framework proposes spacetime has **six discrete dimensions** at Planck scale:
- **3 spatial dimensions** (x, y, z)
- **1 primary temporal dimension** (τ₁) - our experienced time
- **2 internal temporal dimensions** (τ₂, τ₃) - compactified (Kaluza-Klein-like)

Internal temporal dimensions couple to gravity via scalar fields Q₂, Q₃, which emerge from dimensional reduction of the 6D metric tensor. This naturally explains:
- "Dark matter" → Q₂-Q₃ coupling to gravitational potential
- "Dark energy" → τ₃ kinetic energy
- Quantum entanglement → shared paths through hidden temporal dimensions

**Derived from first principles:**
- M-theory 6-brane DBI action
- Quantum field theory separability
- Zero free parameters for Q-field structure
