abstract: >
  We present comprehensive empirical validation of the 3D+3D discrete spacetime theory,
  establishing three independent pillars of evidence for six-dimensional geometry with
  three spatial and three temporal dimensions. The theory naturally unifies quantum
  gravity, dark matter, dark energy, and quantum entanglement through geometric Q-field
  dynamics.
