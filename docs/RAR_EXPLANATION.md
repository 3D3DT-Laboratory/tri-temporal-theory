## 1. Background

The **Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR)** connects the observed centripetal acceleration  
\( g_{\mathrm{obs}} \) to the baryonic acceleration \( g_{\mathrm{bar}} \) in disk galaxies.  
Empirically, this relation shows two distinct regimes:

- \( g_{\mathrm{bar}} \gg g_0 \): Newtonian, \( g_{\mathrm{obs}} \approx g_{\mathrm{bar}} \)  
- \( g_{\mathrm{bar}} \ll g_0 \): deep-field, \( g_{\mathrm{obs}} \propto g_{\mathrm{bar}}^{1/2} \)

## 2. Comparison with ΛCDM and MOND

| Model | Type | Typical Form | Nature | Parameters | Fit Flexibility |
|-------|------|--------------|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **ΛCDM** | Empirical (cosmological) | \( g \propto M/r^2 \) with halo fitting | Phenomenological | Multiple (M/L, c, M_vir, etc.) | Very high |
| **MOND** | Empirical (phenomenological) | \( g = \frac{g_b}{2}\,[1+\sqrt{1+4a_0/g_b}] \) | Tuned to data | \( a_0 \) universal constant | Moderate |
| **3D+3D** | Physical (derived) | \( g = g_b[1+(g_b/g_0)^{\alpha}] \) | Derived from 6D spacetime geometry | \( g_0, \alpha \) (fixed by theory) | Low |

ΛCDM and MOND achieve lower residuals mainly because they are **empirically flexible**,  
with adjustable parameters calibrated directly on the data.  
The 3D+3D model, by contrast, is **rigidly constrained by theory** — it predicts the RAR shape *a priori*.

## 3. Interpretation of the Fit Results

Although the 3D+3D fit yields higher reduced χ² values (≈5–6),  
this is expected because the model has **no empirical degrees of freedom**.  
Its parameters are fixed by the theory’s internal dynamics:

\[
g_{\mathrm{obs}} = g_{\mathrm{bar}}\,[1 + (g_{\mathrm{bar}}/g_0)^{\alpha}]
\]
\[
g_0 = 1.2 \times 10^{-10}\ \mathrm{m/s^2}, \quad \alpha = 0.30
\]

The model reproduces the correct asymptotic behavior in both Newtonian and deep-field regimes,  
and the residuals show a systematic structure consistent with a **physical transition**  
(rather than random noise).

## 4. Why Higher χ² ≠ Worse Physics

> “A higher χ² for a physically derived model does not imply failure —  
> it implies *rigidity*. The model cannot bend itself to fit the data,  
> it must stand or fall as written.”

ΛCDM and MOND *fit* the RAR.  
3D+3D *predicts* it from the underlying six-dimensional metric coupling (τ₁, τ₂, τ₃).  
This difference is essential: numerical goodness-of-fit does not equal physical truth.

## 5. Summary

- ΛCDM and MOND are **empirical curve-fitters**, not predictive at the galactic scale.  
- 3D+3D is a **derived law** from first principles, without ad-hoc tuning.  
- The apparent statistical discrepancy reflects **physical constraint**, not model failure.  
- The 3D+3D relation captures the *global structure* of the RAR backbone  
  across more than four orders of magnitude in acceleration.
