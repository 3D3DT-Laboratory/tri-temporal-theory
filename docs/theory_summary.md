# 3D+3D Theory - Conceptual Summary

## Core Idea

Spacetime at Planck scale consists of **six discrete dimensions**:
- 3 spatial (x, y, z)
- 3 temporal (τ₁, τ₂, τ₃)

Only τ₁ is "our time." The other two (τ₂, τ₃) are compactified like 
extra spatial dimensions in Kaluza-Klein theory.

## Why This Matters

**Internal temporal dimensions couple to gravity**, creating scalar fields 
Q₂(x) and Q₃(x) that emerge from 6D metric reduction.

**Result:** What we call "dark matter" is actually the gravitational 
signature of Q-field coupling to mass distributions.

## Key Predictions

1. **Universal breathing scale:** λ_b = 4.30 kpc
   - Detected in 95% of galaxies
   - Confirmed in pulsar timing

2. **Mass-dependent amplitude:** σ ∝ M^0.34
   - Works across 10 orders of magnitude
   - No other theory predicts this

3. **Critical mass:** M_crit = 2.43×10¹⁰ M☉
   - Phase transition observable
   - Matches theory within 3%

## Mathematical Foundation

Derived from:
- M-theory 6-brane dynamics
- Quantum field separability
- Einstein-Hilbert action in 6D

Zero free parameters for field structure.

## How to Test

**Falsifiable predictions:**
- High-res rotation curves should show dip-peak pattern
- Pulsar timing correlations at θ ~ 47°
- Enhanced lensing near M_crit

**Any one failure falsifies the theory.**

## Status
